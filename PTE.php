                    <p>Getting a good college, having a good education, and then achieving something in their life is everyone’s dream. All the people are working hard to achieve their dreams; they work the whole day and night to get into a good college. But the competition is very high these days, so there is no
                            guarantee that even with this hard work, you will get to your dream college.</p>
                        <p>So, you can choose another option to get good scores in the PTE exam and then continue your study in good
                            foreign colleges. But what is PTE? This question can come to your mind.</p>
                        <p>If I explain it in simple words, then PTE is an exam in which a candidate gets scores based on their knowledge of the English language, and these
                            scores help them to get admission in the colleges of English-speaking countries.</p>
                        <p>This is the simplest definition of PTE, but if you want
                            to know in detail about what is PTE, then keep reading this blog till the end.</p>
                        <p>Because in this blog, I will give you complete information about PTE, its exam format,
                            pte exam preparation, pte practice, pte scorecard so keep scrolling to the end.</p>

                        <p><strong>Meaning of PTE</strong></p>
                        <p>PTE, whose full form is the Pearson Test of English, is an exam that is attempted by the students of non-English speaking countries
                            who want to join the colleges or universities of English speaking countries.</p>
                        <p>This is a computer-based English language test that is accepted by many colleges, universities or other educational institutes of many countries. Pearson Pte conducts this exam. This exam tests the English language skills of their
                            candidate and then gives them scores based on their performances in the test.</p>
                        <p>Then candidates can apply for the universities or colleges of other countries based on their scores. You can’t fail or pass this exam; there are no such criteria for this. But your score will still make a difference in your chances of getting admission to the college or university
                            that you chose. Every college and university has its own requirement of scores.</p>
                        <p>Some universities or colleges even select candidates with scores around 57. And some universities and colleges even reject the candidates with a score of around 62. So, always try to get
                            as high scores as you can, so you can get your dream university or college.</p>

                        <p><strong>What are the Types of PTE?</strong></p>
                        <p>Most of you probably do not know that the
                            PTE exam has three types; Pearson PTE conducts three types of PTE exam -:</p>
                        <p>PTE General
                            PTE Academic
                            PTE young learners</p>

                        <p><strong>1.PTE Young Learners</strong></p>
                        <p>It is a fun test that can be attempted by children aged between 6 years to 13 years.</p>
                        <p>This test contains sections like group speaking, board games, story writing,
                            picture matching, etc. The score of this test remains valid for a lifetime.</p>

                        <p><strong>2.PTE General</strong></p>
                        <p>Pearson PTE conducts this test
                            3 times in a year. This exam is mostly conducted in May, June, and December.</p>
                        <p>This exam has two types of tests: Written Paper and Spoken test; spoken test
                            is like an interview which candidates have to attempt in PTE General.</p>
                        <p>Based on these two tests, this exam evaluates the reading, listening, speaking
                            and writing skills of the candidate and gives the score to the candidate according to their performance.</p>
                        <p>The score of this exam has lifetime validity. But this is not an English proficiency test; you can’t apply for a college on the basis of these exam scores.
                            Candidates mostly attempt this exam to check their knowledge of the English language.</p>

                        <p><strong>3.PTE Academic</strong></p>
                        <p>This is the most important exam if you want to study in an English speaking country.</p>
                        <p>You can give this exam any month in the whole year; you can check the exam dates on the official website of Pearson PTE.</p>
                        <p>This exam has four tests: Reading,
                            Speaking, Listening, Writing, and candidates have to get enough scores in all four sections.</p>
                        <p>It is a computer-based exam; you have to go
                            to the exam centre of Pearson, they will provide you with computers and then you can give your exam.</p>
                        <p>The validity of the PTE Academic exam is 2 Years.</p>
